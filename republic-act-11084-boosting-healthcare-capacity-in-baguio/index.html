This crucial piece of legislation was principally authored in the House of Representatives by Baguio City's lone district representative, Congressman Mark Go.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Titled "An Act Increasing the Bed Capacity of the Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center From Five Hundred (500) to Eight Hundred (800) Beds and Appropriating Funds Therefor,"</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the law mandates a 60% increase in the hospital's bed capacity, from the previous 500 beds to 800. This expansion was a direct response championed by Congressman Go and other proponents to address the growing healthcare needs of Baguio City and the surrounding provinces served by BGHMC, which frequently faced challenges with overcrowding and strained resources.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congressman Go's authorship of House Bill 6619, which became the basis for Republic Act 11084, underscored his commitment to enhancing the healthcare infrastructure in his constituency. His initiative was instrumental in pushing for the legislative action required to facilitate the much-needed expansion of BGHMC.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond merely increasing the number of beds, Republic Act 11084, as envisioned by its authors, also necessitates the upgrading of the hospital's existing service facilities and professional healthcare services to be commensurate with the expanded capacity. This includes improving medical equipment, infrastructure, and the range of specialized services offered to ensure quality patient care aligned with the increased patient intake.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A crucial component of the act, strongly advocated for during its deliberation, is the corresponding increase in the BGHMC's workforce. The Department of Health (DOH), in coordination with the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and the Civil Service Commission</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CSC), is tasked with determining and creating the necessary additional plantilla positions to support the increased bed capacity and upgraded services. This aims to address potential staffing shortages that could arise from the hospital's expansion and ensure that the quality of care is not compromised.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The implementation of the increase in bed capacity and the associated upgrades is stipulated to be carried out over a period not exceeding three years from the effectivity of the act. The Secretary of Health is responsible for including the funding requirements for the implementation of Republic Act 11084 in the annual General Appropriations Act, a process that requires continued legislative support, which Congressman Go has actively pursued.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the enactment of Republic Act 11084 repealed Republic Act No. 8634, the previous law that had increased the bed capacity of BGHMC from 400 to 500 beds. This signifies a comprehensive legislative update concerning the hospital's authorized capacity, superseding prior mandates.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Health has since issued the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) for Republic Act 11084 through Administrative Order No. 2019-0016. This detailed guideline provides the framework for the systematic implementation of the law, outlining the responsibilities of various stakeholders and the procedures for achieving the mandated increase in bed capacity, upgrading of services and facilities, and augmentation of the workforce, building upon the foundation laid by Congressman Go's principal authorship.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In essence, Republic Act 11084 is a vital piece of legislation that directly addresses the need for enhanced healthcare infrastructure and services in Northern Luzon through the significant expansion of the Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center. Congressman Mark Go's role as the principal author of the House Bill that led to this act highlights his dedication to improving healthcare access and quality for his constituents and the broader community served by BGHMC. Its successful implementation is expected to improve access to quality medical care for a larger population and alleviate the burden on the existing healthcare system in the region.</span></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on May 4, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://www.markgo.org/tags/legislative-work/index.html">Legislative Work</a></li><li><a href="https://www.markgo.org/tags/signed-into-law/index.html">Signed into Law</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.markgo.org/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.markgo.org%2Frepublic-act-11084-boosting-healthcare-capacity-in-baguio%2Findex.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.markgo.org/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://www.markgo.org/authors/mark-go/index.html" rel="author">Mark Go</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://www.markgo.org/republic-act-11032-the-ease-of-doing-business-and-efficient-government-service-delivery-act-of-2018/index.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Republic Act 11032: The Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act of 2018</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://www.markgo.org/republic-act-11509-the-doktor-para-sa-bayan-act/index.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Republic Act 11509: The Doktor Para sa Bayan Act</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://www.markgo.org/republic-act-11984-ending-the-no-permit-no-exam-policy-for-disadvantaged-students/index.html">Republic Act 11984: Ending the &quot;No Permit, No Exam&quot;
