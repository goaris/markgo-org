This act is dedicated to rationalizing and strengthening technical-vocational education and training (TVET) in the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) by establishing a unified state-run technical-vocational institution.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The primary purpose of RA 11192 is to create the Cordillera State Institute of Technical Education (CSITE) under the supervision of the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is achieved by integrating the existing TESDA training centers and TESDA-supervised state-run technical-vocational institutions (TVIs) across the Cordillera region into a single, cohesive institute.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This integration aims to optimize resources, standardize program offerings, and improve the overall quality and responsiveness of TVET in the CAR.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The establishment of CSITE is seen as a crucial step in developing a highly skilled and competitive workforce in the Cordillera Administrative Region. The Institute is mandated to offer a range of programs, including short-term specialty courses and longer-term technical-vocational education at the technical diploma and national certificate levels.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">3</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> These programs are intended to cater to the specific needs of the region's industries and economy, equipping graduates with employable skills for both domestic and international markets.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">4</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RA 11192 emphasizes the role of CSITE in providing accessible and relevant technical-vocational education and skills training to students, out-of-school youth, and residents from low-income families, including persons with disabilities, across Baguio City and the provinces of Abra, Apayao, Benguet, Ifugao, Kalinga, and Mountain Province.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">5</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The law envisions CSITE playing a pivotal role in poverty reduction and economic development in the region through skills development and livelihood opportunities.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The integration of existing TESDA institutions under CSITE involves the consolidation of their assets, personnel, programs, and resources. This process, overseen by TESDA in coordination with relevant government agencies and stakeholders, aims to create a more efficient and effective system for delivering TVET in the Cordillera.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The enactment of RA 11192 was a significant legislative achievement for the Cordillera region. Notably, the corresponding House Bill that led to this Republic Act was principally authored by Congressman Mark Go of Baguio City. His advocacy and efforts were instrumental in pushing for the passage of this law, highlighting the importance of strengthening technical-vocational education as a key driver for the region's growth and human capital development.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In accordance with the act, TESDA is responsible for the operationalization of CSITE and the issuance of the necessary implementing rules and regulations to ensure its effective functioning.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">6</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The establishment of CSITE under RA 11192 is expected to lead to a more standardized, accessible, and responsive TVET system in the Cordillera Administrative Region, ultimately contributing to improved employment opportunities and socio-economic progress for its residents.</span></p><p>Â </p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on May 4, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.markgo.org/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.markgo.org%2Frepublic-act-11192-establishing-the-cordillera-state-institute-of-technical-education-csite%2Findex.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.markgo.org/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://www.markgo.org/authors/mark-go/index.html" rel="author">Mark Go</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://www.markgo.org/republic-act-10931-universal-access-to-quality-tertiary-education-act/index.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Republic Act 10931: Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://www.markgo.org/republic-act-12063-boosting-filipino-workforce-skills-through-enterprise-based-training/index.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Republic Act 12063: Boosting Filipino Workforce Skills through Enterprise-Based Training</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://www.markgo.org/republic-act-11984-ending-the-no-permit-no-exam-policy-for-disadvantaged-students/index.html">Republic Act 11984: Ending the &quot;No Permit, No Exam&quot;
