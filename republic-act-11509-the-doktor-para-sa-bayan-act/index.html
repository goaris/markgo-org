known as the "</span><strong>Doktor Para sa Bayan Act</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">," is a significant Philippine law enacted on December 23, 2020.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This Act establishes a Medical Scholarship and Return Service Program aimed at addressing the persistent lack of doctors in the country, particularly in underserved and rural areas.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The core purpose of the Doktor Para sa Bayan Act is to incentivize deserving Filipino students to pursue a Doctor of Medicine degree by providing them with financial assistance and, in return, requiring them to render service in government public health offices or hospitals upon becoming licensed physicians.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">3</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This mechanism seeks to produce aSaya of doctors who are committed to serving the health needs of underprivileged communities and ultimately improve the doctor-to-population ratio across the archipelago.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key provisions of Republic Act 11509 include:</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Establishment of the Medical Scholarship and Return Service Program (MSRS):</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Act mandates the creation of a scholarship program for deserving students in State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) or in partner private Higher Education Institutions (PHEIs) in regions where</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">4</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> no SUCs offer a medical course.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">56</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Prioritization of Deserving Students:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The program prioritizes qualified applicants from municipalities without government physicians to ensure that these underserved areas will eventually have access to medical doctors.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">7</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Comprehensive Financial Assistance:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The scholarship program covers various expenses, including free tuition and other school fees, allowances for books, supplies, equipment, clothing, dormitory or boarding house accommodation, transportation, internship fees, medical board review fees, license fees, annual medical insurance, and other education-related miscellaneous and living allowances.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Qualification Requirements:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Applicants must be Filipino citizens residing in the Philippines, be a graduating student or a graduate of an appropriate undergraduate program, have passed the required entrance examinations and complied with admission requirements of the medical school, and have obtained the mandated National Medical Admission Test (NMAT) score.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">8</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Mandatory Return Service:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A crucial component of the scholarship is the mandatory return service.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">9</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Upon passing the Physician Licensure Examination and obtaining their license, scholars are required to serve in a government public health office, government hospital, or any accredited government health facility</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">10</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in their hometown or an underserved municipality.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">11</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The duration of the return service is proportionate to the length of the scholarship availed.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Integration into the Public Health System:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Act facilitates the integration of scholars into the public health and medical service system through the Department of Health (DOH), ensuring they receive appropriate civil service ranks and compensation during their return service.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">12</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Formulation of Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR):</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and the DOH are mandated to jointly formulate and issue the IRR to ensure the effective implementation of the Act.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">13</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Sanctions:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Act includes provisions for sanctions for failure to comply with the mandatory return service obligation, which may include the repayment of the scholarship cost and other penalties.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">14</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Doktor Para sa Bayan Act is a crucial step towards strengthening the healthcare system in the Philippines by addressing the shortage of medical professionals and promoting equitable access to healthcare services, particularly in remote and underserved areas.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">15</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It provides a pathway for aspiring doctors from various backgrounds to pursue medical education and contribute to the well-being of their communities.</span><span style="font-weight:
