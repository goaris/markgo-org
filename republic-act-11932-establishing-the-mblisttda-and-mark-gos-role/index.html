He played a significant role in initiating and championing the creation of the MBLISTTDA in the House of Representatives. His authorship signifies his recognition of the need for a unified body to address the metropolitan challenges of Baguio and its surrounding </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">municipalities and his commitment toเห็นชอบ the legislative process that led to its enactment. While the Senate version of the bill would have had its own sponsors, Congressman Go's role as a principal author of the House version highlights his crucial contribution to bringing this legislation to fruition.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The establishment of the MBLISTTDA through RA 11932 is a significant step towards integrated development planning and service delivery in the BLISTT area, aiming to address common issues more effectively and promote sustainable growth for the benefit of its residents. The involvement of legislators like Mark Go from the concerned areas was instrumental in pushing for the passage of this important law.</span></p><p><br><br></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://www.markgo.org/tags/legislative-work/index.html">Legislative Work</a></li><li><a href="https://www.markgo.org/tags/signed-into-law/index.html">Signed into Law</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.markgo.org/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.markgo.org%2Frepublic-act-11932-establishing-the-mblisttda-and-mark-gos-role%2Findex.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.markgo.org/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span></a></div></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://www.markgo.org/republic-act-11604-mandating-the-full-rehabilitation-and-maintenance-of-kennon-road/index.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Republic Act 11604: Mandating the Full Rehabilitation and Maintenance of Kennon Road</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://www.markgo.org/republic-act-11982-expanding-benefits-for-elderly-filipinos-with-congressman-mark-go-as-author/index.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Republic Act 11982: Expanding Benefits for Elderly Filipinos</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-12-06T12:08" class="feed__date">December 6, 2024</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://www.markgo.org/republic-act-12077-providing-relief-on-student-loan-payments-during-calamities/index.html">Republic Act 12077: Providing Relief on Student Loan Payments During Calamities</a></h3></header><p>Republic Act No. 12077, also known as the "Student Loan Payment Moratorium During Disasters and Emergencies Act," is a recently enacted Philippine law approved on December 6, 2024.
