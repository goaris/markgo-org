Republic Act 11982 amends this by extending a cash gift of PHP 10,000 to Filipinos upon reaching the ages of eighty (80), eighty-five (85), ninety (90), and ninety-five (95) years old.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The existing PHP 100,000 cash gift for centenarians is retained. This expansion of benefits acknowledges and celebrates the lives of a larger number of senior citizens.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the cash gifts, the act also mandates the establishment of an Elderly Data Management System to be maintained by the National Commission of Senior Citizens (NCSC).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This system, to be developed in coordination with relevant government agencies like the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT), and local government units</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (LGUs), aims to ensure the effective identification, registration, and monitoring of beneficiaries for the seamless implementation of the law.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The enactment of Republic Act 11982 is a result of consolidated legislative efforts from both the Senate and the House of Representatives. The law is a consolidation of Senate Bill No. 2028 and House Bill No. 7535, which were passed by their respective chambers on December 6, 2023.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congressman Go was an author of House Bill No. 7535, one of the precursor bills to Republic Act 11982. His authorship signifies his commitment to advocating for the welfare and recognition of senior citizens. By pushing for this expanded benefits package, Congressman Go and his fellow authors aimed to provide tangible support and acknowledge the valuable role that octogenarians and nonagenarians continue to play in Filipino families and society.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funding for the implementation of Republic Act 11982 is to be included in the annual General Appropriations Act, ensuring that the necessary budget is allocated to provide the mandated cash gifts and establish the required data management system.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republic Act 11982 is a significant stride in enhancing the welfare of elderly Filipinos by providing expanded financial benefits to octogenarians and nonagenarians. The role of Congressman Mark Go, who authored the pertinent House Bill, was crucial in championing this cause and ensuring the passage of this compassionate law that honors the nation's elderly population.</span></p><p> </p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://www.markgo.org/tags/legislative-work/index.html">Legislative Work</a></li><li><a href="https://www.markgo.org/tags/signed-into-law/index.html">Signed into Law</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.markgo.org/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.markgo.org%2Frepublic-act-11982-expanding-benefits-for-elderly-filipinos-with-congressman-mark-go-as-author%2Findex.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.markgo.org/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span></a></div></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://www.markgo.org/republic-act-11932-establishing-the-mblisttda-and-mark-gos-role/index.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Republic Act 11932: Establishing the MBLISTTDA </div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://www.markgo.org/republic-act-11984-ending-the-no-permit-no-exam-policy-for-disadvantaged-students/index.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Republic Act 11984: Ending the &quot;No Permit, No Exam&quot; Policy for Disadvantaged Students</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-12-06T12:08" class="feed__date">December 6, 2024</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://www.markgo.org/republic-act-12077-providing-relief-on-student-loan-payments-during-calamities/index.html">Republic Act 12077: Providing Relief on Student Loan Payments During Calamities</a></h3></header><p>Republic Act No. 12077, also known as the "Student Loan Payment Moratorium During Disasters and Emergencies Act," is a recently enacted Philippine law approved on December 6, 2024.
