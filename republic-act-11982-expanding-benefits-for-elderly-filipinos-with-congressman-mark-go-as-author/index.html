Republic Act 11982 amends this by extending a cash gift of PHP 10,000 to Filipinos upon reaching the ages of eighty (80), eighty-five (85), ninety (90), and ninety-five (95) years old.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">3</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The existing PHP 100,000 cash gift for centenarians is retained. This expansion of benefits acknowledges and celebrates the lives of a larger number of senior citizens.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the cash gifts, the act also mandates the establishment of an Elderly Data Management System to be maintained by the National Commission of Senior Citizens (NCSC).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">4</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This system, to be developed in coordination with relevant government agencies like the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT), and local government units</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">5</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (LGUs), aims to ensure the effective identification, registration, and monitoring of beneficiaries for the seamless implementation of the law.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">6</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The enactment of Republic Act 11982 is a result of consolidated legislative efforts from both the Senate and the House of Representatives. The law is a consolidation of Senate Bill No. 2028 and House Bill No. 7535, which were passed by their respective chambers on December 6, 2023.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key figure in the passage of this significant legislation in the House of Representatives was Congressman Mark Go, the representative of the lone district of Baguio City. Congressman Go was an author of House Bill No. 7535, one of the precursor bills to Republic Act 11982. His authorship signifies his commitment to advocating for the welfare and recognition of senior citizens. By pushing for this expanded benefits package, Congressman Go and his fellow authors aimed to provide tangible support and acknowledge the valuable role that octogenarians and nonagenarians continue to play in Filipino families and society.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funding for the implementation of Republic Act 11982 is to be included in the annual General Appropriations Act, ensuring that the necessary budget is allocated to provide the mandated cash gifts and establish the required data management system.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In summary, Republic Act 11982 is a significant stride in enhancing the welfare of elderly Filipinos by providing expanded financial benefits to octogenarians and nonagenarians. The role of legislators like Congressman Mark Go, who authored the pertinent House Bill, was crucial in championing this cause and ensuring the passage of this compassionate law that honors the nation's elderly population.</span></p><p> </p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on May 4, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://markgo.org/tags/legislative-work/index.html">Legislative Work</a></li><li><a href="https://markgo.org/tags/signed-into-law/index.html">Signed into Law</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://markgo.org/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmarkgo.org%2Frepublic-act-11982-expanding-benefits-for-elderly-filipinos-with-congressman-mark-go-as-author%2Findex.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://markgo.org/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://markgo.org/authors/mark-go/index.html" rel="author">Mark Go</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://markgo.org/republic-acts-11623-and-11624-establishing-new-national-high-schools-in-baguio-city-with-the-support-of-congressman-mark-go/index.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Republic Acts 11623 and 11624: Establishing New National High Schools in Baguio City with the Support of Congressman Mark Go</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://markgo.org/republic-act-12077-providing-relief-on-student-loan-payments-during-calamities/index.html">Republic Act 12077: Providing Relief on Student Loan Payments During Calamities</a></h3></header><p>Republic Act No. 12077, also known as the "Student Loan Payment Moratorium During Disasters and Emergencies Act," is a recently enacted Philippine law approved on December 6, 2024.1 This Act provides much-needed financial relief to students and their families who are grappling with the aftermath&hellip;</p><a href="https://markgo.org/republic-act-12077-providing-relief-on-student-loan-payments-during-calamities/index.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://markgo.org/republic-act-12080-boosting-mental-health-and-well-being-in-basic-education/index.html">Republic Act 12080: Boosting Mental Health and Well-Being in Basic Education</a></h3></header><p>Republic Act No. 12080, officially known as the "Basic Education Mental Health and Well-Being Promotion Act," is a crucial piece of Philippine legislation approved on December 6, 2024.1 Recognizing the growing mental health challenges faced by students and personnel in the basic education sector, this&hellip;</p><a href="https://markgo.org/republic-act-12080-boosting-mental-health-and-well-being-in-basic-education/index.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://markgo.org/republic-act-12063-boosting-filipino-workforce-skills-through-enterprise-based-training/index.html">Republic Act 12063: Boosting Filipino Workforce Skills through Enterprise-Based Training</a></h3></header><p>Republic Act No. 12063, or the Enterprise-Based Education and Training (EBET) Framework Act, is a significant piece of legislation in the Philippines signed into law by President Ferdinand R.
