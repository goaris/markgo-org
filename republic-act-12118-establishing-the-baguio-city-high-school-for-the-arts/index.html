It is also mandated to work in close coordination with the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) and the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">4</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">5</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> collaborative framework aims to ensure that the school's curriculum and programs are aligned with national arts and culture standards and provide students with access to expertise and resources from the country's premier cultural institutions.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">6</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The establishment of this specialized high school is a testament to the State's commitment to fostering the preservation, enrichment, and dynamic evolution of Filipino national culture. By providing specialized training and education, the Act seeks to develop a new generation of artists and cultural practitioners.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">7</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislative journey of Republic Act 12118 began in the House of Representatives as House Bill No. 7316.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">8</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The primary author and sponsor of this foundational bill was Congressman Mark Go, the representative of the lone district of Baguio City. His leadership and advocacy were crucial in championing the establishment of a dedicated arts high school in Baguio, a city recognized for its vibrant creative scene and its designation as a UNESCO Creative City. Congressman Go's initiative underscores his commitment to providing specialized educational opportunities that cater to the diverse talents of his constituents and students from the greater Northern Luzon area.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initial funding for the operationalization of the Baguio City High School for the Arts is charged against the current year's appropriation of the Schools Division Office of Baguio City, with subsequent funding to be included in the annual General Appropriations Act.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">9</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The DepEd, in coordination with the NCCA, CCP, and the local government of Baguio City, is tasked with promulgating the rules and regulations for the effective implementation of the Act.</span></p><p><strong>Congressman Mark Go's Role in Republic Acts 11623 and 11624</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond his primary authorship of the law establishing the Baguio City High School for the Arts, Congressman Mark Go also played a supportive role in the enactment of two other significant education-related laws in Baguio City during the 18th Congress: Republic Act 11623 and Republic Act 11624.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republic Act 11623, enacted on December 10, 2021, is "AN ACT SEPARATING THE BAGUIO CITY NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL – FORT DEL PILAR ANNEX IN BARANGAY FORT DEL PILAR, BAGUIO CITY FROM THE BAGUIO CITY NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL, CONVERTING IT INTO AN INDEPENDENT NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL TO BE KNOWN AS THE FORT DEL PILAR NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR."</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1011</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This law effectively converted the Fort Del Pilar Annex into an independent national high school, ensuring it would have its own administration and dedicated funding.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, Republic Act 11624, also enacted on December 10, 2021, is "AN ACT SEPARATING THE BAGUIO CITY NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL – HILLSIDE ANNEX IN BARANGAY HILLSIDE, BAGUIO CITY FROM THE BAGUIO CITY NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL, CONVERTING IT INTO AN INDEPENDENT NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL TO BE KNOWN</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">12</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> AS THE HILLSIDE NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR."</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1314</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This act provided the same independence and dedicated resources for the Hillside Annex, establishing it as the Hillside National High School.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congressman Mark Go was listed as a co-sponsor of House Bill No. 7994, which led to RA 11623, and House Bill No. 7995, which led to RA 11624. His co-sponsorship of these bills demonstrates his support for the decentralization of large school annexes in his district, aiming to improve their administrative efficiency and ensure they receive adequate resources for the benefit of their students and faculty.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In summary, Congressman Mark Go has been a consistent advocate for educational advancement in Baguio City through his legislative work. His primary authorship of Republic Act 12118 paved the way for a specialized arts high school, while his co-sponsorship of the bills that became Republic Acts 11623 and 11624 contributed to the establishment of independent national high schools from former annexes, all aimed at providing better educational opportunities for the youth in his district.</span></p><p><br><br></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://www.markgo.org/tags/legislative-work/index.html">Legislative Work</a></li><li><a href="https://www.markgo.org/tags/signed-into-law/index.html">Signed into Law</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.markgo.org/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.markgo.org%2Frepublic-act-12118-establishing-the-baguio-city-high-school-for-the-arts%2Findex.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.markgo.org/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span></a></div></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://www.markgo.org/republic-act-12119-establishing-the-baguio-city-sports-high-school-championed-by-congressman-mark-go/index.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Republic Act 12119: Establishing the Baguio City Sports High School</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-12-06T12:08" class="feed__date">December 6, 2024</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://www.markgo.org/republic-act-12077-providing-relief-on-student-loan-payments-during-calamities/index.html">Republic Act 12077: Providing Relief on Student Loan Payments During Calamities</a></h3></header><p>Republic Act No. 12077, also known as the "Student Loan Payment Moratorium During Disasters and Emergencies Act," is a recently enacted Philippine law approved on December 6, 2024.
