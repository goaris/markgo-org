The Act aims to provide a dedicated educational institution that combines a standard secondary education curriculum with intensive sports training for students who have demonstrated considerable potential in various sports disciplines.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key provisions of Republic Act 12119 include:</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Establishment of the Baguio City Sports High School:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The law mandates the creation of a specialized public high school in Baguio City that will offer a sports-focused education program.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">3</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Integrated Curriculum:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The school will implement the general secondary education curriculum as prescribed by the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (RA 10533), with a significant emphasis on developing the athletic skills of learners through specialized subjects in physical education and sports.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">4</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Coordination with Sports Authorities:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The school will be administered and supervised by the Department of Education (DepEd) in close coordination with the Philippine Sports Commission</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">5</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (PSC) and the National Academy of Sports (NAS).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">67</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This collaboration is intended to ensure that the sports programs are aligned with national sports development goals and standards.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Funding:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The initial funding for the operationalization of the Baguio City Sports High School will be charged against the current year's appropriation of the Schools Division Office of Baguio City, with subsequent funding to be included in the annual General Appropriations Act.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">8</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The establishment of the Baguio City Sports High School is expected to provide a clear pathway for talented young athletes in Baguio and the broader Northern Luzon area to receive quality education while simultaneously developing their athletic prowess.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">9</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This specialized training is crucial for producing future national athletes who can represent the country in various competitions.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislative effort behind Republic Act 12119 was notably led by Congressman Mark Go, the representative of the lone district of Baguio City. He served as the primary author and sponsor of House Bill No. 8700, the precursor to this Republic Act in the House of Representatives. Congressman Go's strong advocacy for sports development and his commitment to providing specialized educational opportunities for the youth of Baguio were instrumental in the passage of this law. His initiative reflects a vision to harness the athletic potential of young Filipinos and provide them with the necessary support and training to excel in their chosen sports.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The enactment of RA 12119, alongside RA 12118 establishing the Baguio City High School for the Arts (which Congressman Go also primarily authored), signifies a concerted effort to provide specialized educational institutions in Baguio City that cater to the diverse talents and potentials of students in the region.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">10</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Congressman Go's role as the primary author and sponsor of both these landmark laws underscores his dedication to enhancing the educational landscape and providing unique opportunities for the youth in his constituency.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Education, in coordination with the PSC, NAS, and the local government of Baguio City, is tasked with formulating the implementing rules and regulations for RA 12119 to ensure the effective organization, administration, operations, and management of the Baguio City Sports High School.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">11</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This will be crucial in translating the vision of the law into tangible opportunities for aspiring young athletes.</span></p><p> </p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on May 4, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul
