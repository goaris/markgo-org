Congressman Mark Go, the representative of Baguio City's lone district, played a supportive role in the passage of these laws as a co-sponsor of the corresponding House Bills.</span></p><p><strong>Republic Act 11623: Establishing Fort Del Pilar National High School</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republic Act 11623 is titled "<em><strong>AN ACT SEPARATING THE BAGUIO CITY NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL – FORT DEL PILAR ANNEX IN BARANGAY FORT DEL PILAR, BAGUIO CITY FROM THE BAGUIO CITY NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL, CONVERTING IT INTO AN INDEPENDENT NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL TO BE KNOWN AS THE FORT DEL PILAR NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR</strong></em>."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This act effectively grants the Fort Del Pilar Annex of Baguio City National High School (BCNHS) autonomy, converting it into a standalone national high school.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The key provisions of RA 11623 include the formal separation of the annex, the transfer of all its existing personnel, assets, liabilities, and records to the newly created Fort Del Pilar National High School.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Department of Education (DepEd) is mandated to include the operationalization of the new school in its program, with initial funding sourced from the annex's current year appropriation, and subsequent funding to be included in the annual General Appropriations Act.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This ensures dedicated resources for the school's operations and development.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The enactment of RA 11623 originated from House Bill No. 7994 in the 18th Congress. Congressman Mark Go was listed as a co-sponsor of this bill, indicating his support for the conversion of the Fort Del Pilar Annex into an independent national high school and his recognition of the need for enhanced educational facilities and administration in the area it serves.</span></p><p><strong>Republic Act 11624: Establishing Hillside National High School</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, Republic Act 11624 is titled "<em><strong>AN ACT SEPARATING THE BAGUIO CITY NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL – HILLSIDE ANNEX IN BARANGAY HILLSIDE, BAGUIO CITY FROM THE BAGUIO CITY NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL, CONVERTING IT INTO AN INDEPENDENT NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL TO BE KNOWN AS THE HILLSIDE NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR</strong></em>."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This law mirrors the provisions of RA 11623, focusing on the Hillside Annex of BCNHS. It legally separates the Hillside Annex and converts it into the independent Hillside National High School.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The act also dictates the transfer of all personnel, assets, liabilities, and records from the annex to the new school. Like RA 11623, it directs the DepEd to facilitate the operationalization of Hillside National High School and ensures its funding through inclusion in the annual General Appropriations Act, starting with the annex's current allocation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republic Act 11624 originated from House Bill No. 7995 in the 18th Congress. Congressman Mark Go was also a co-sponsor of this bill. His co-sponsorship of both House Bills 7994 and 7995 demonstrates his commitment to improving the educational infrastructure and opportunities available to students in different barangays within Baguio City by supporting the independence and dedicated resourcing of these former annexes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republic Acts 11623 and 11624 are crucial legislative steps towards providing more focused and adequately supported secondary education in the Fort Del Pilar and Hillside areas of Baguio City. Congressman Mark Go's role as a co-sponsor of the foundational House Bills for both acts highlights his advocacy for enhanced educational services and his support for initiatives that directly benefit the students and communities within his district. These laws are expected to lead to improved school administration, targeted program development, and better overall learning environments in the newly established Fort Del Pilar National High School and Hillside National High School.</span></p><p> </p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://www.markgo.org/tags/legislative-work/index.html">Legislative Work</a></li><li><a href="https://www.markgo.org/tags/signed-into-law/index.html">Signed into Law</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.markgo.org/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.markgo.org%2Frepublic-acts-11623-and-11624-establishing-new-national-high-schools-in-baguio-city-with-the-support-of-congressman-mark-go%2Findex.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.markgo.org/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span></a></div></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://www.markgo.org/republic-act-11509-the-doktor-para-sa-bayan-act/index.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Republic Act 11509: The Doktor Para sa Bayan Act</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://www.markgo.org/republic-act-11604-mandating-the-full-rehabilitation-and-maintenance-of-kennon-road/index.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Republic Act 11604: Mandating the Full Rehabilitation and Maintenance of Kennon Road</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-12-06T12:08" class="feed__date">December 6, 2024</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://www.markgo.org/republic-act-12077-providing-relief-on-student-loan-payments-during-calamities/index.html">Republic Act 12077: Providing Relief on Student Loan Payments During Calamities</a></h3></header><p>Republic Act No. 12077, also known as the "Student Loan Payment Moratorium During Disasters and Emergencies Act," is a recently enacted Philippine law approved on December 6, 2024.
